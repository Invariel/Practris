# Practris

Practris is a training and practice tool for the immensely popular game Tetris.

Unlike most Tetris variants, the goal here is not to clear lines really fast and rack up your score; instead its goal is to let you practice piece placement and learn how the rotation system works, to ultimately reduce decision making speed so that you can play a better game at higher speeds.

Practris incorporates most of the (Super Rotation System)[https://tetris.wiki/Super_Rotation_System], most notably omitting "Up" for drop and not including piece gravity at all.

It was devised as a birthday present for my girlfriend, and I have no desire to profit from its creation.  Nor should you.
